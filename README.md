## 1. Knowing your prospective employer
These days there are tons of resources that allow you search millions of jobs. Landing a job interview feels great, but how much do we really know about our future employer? The job posts on job search engines often elicit more questions than answers. It is necessary to get inside information about the company as this one factor can define the difference between getting a job from a great company and heading down the wrong path.

Having as much knowledge about your prospective company is in your big interest. Knowing what past/current employees or people think about your prospective employer is as important as knowing what the company does. Listening to casual comments from people about your future employer seem more appealing. The best source of getting these insights would be through social media interactions such as tweets, posts, etc. And scoring the employers based on this will be valuable information to the job seekers. Job seekers would like their prospective employers to be scored in categories such as:  
. Work processes  
·         Ethics and integrity  
·         Quality and customer focus  
·         Work/life balance  
·         Leadership and Management  
·         Teamwork and cooperation  
·         Job security and career growth  
·         Training and development  
·         Rewards and recognition  
Thus, the analytical application will help the job seekers know more what others say about their prospective employers.

## 2. Assist health insurance companies in classifying and charging customers by predicting their health risk
From the perspective of protecting oneself from the unexpected turn of events, having health insurance has become one of the topmost priority. That is why now almost every person has a health insurance. Thriving on this necessity, many health insurance companies have made fortune for themselves. The health insurance company offers coverage for surgical and medical expenses for which a customer is charged a monthly or a yearly premium. The premium mainly depends on the risk factor of the customer in terms of possibility of a health problem(s). Thus, more the risk, more will be the premium.  

The challenge here is determining the risk factor in terms of statistical information as the companies have data of customers accumulated over a decade through info provided in their insurance applications, pre-medical history and recordings of regular check-ups.  

Based on this data, many surveys and extensive researches have come up with certain factors such as BMI, smoking or drinking habits, age, gender, medical history, family/genetic history, lifestyle, location of residence etc. which can affect the risk of an individual prone to health problems. While some of the factors are unchangeable (Genetic history, gender), some are variable (BMI, Age, Lifestyle). Thus, they need to be taken into account to update the customer data. 
A solution can be provided by assessing these factors and coming up with a risk profile, a profile of risk indicator. Based on the result of risk profile, the company receives:  
1. A decision whether to provide health insurance to a customer  
2. Classification of the customer according to health risks   
3. The amount of premium to be charged and updated premium amount as the risk profile is updated  
4. Suggestion of an insurance plan for the customer  
Thus, the application provides solution over lack of method to build a metric system for health risk prediction and overcoming the challenge of analyzing the huge data and making updated decisions.

## 3.Epidemics Alert System
 
Abstract: Infectious diseases are leading cause of mortality and morbidity in all countries. In developing countries, the concern is detecting infectious disease outbreaks early and stopping their mortality, spread and potential impact on society. Epidemics alert system will act as mediator between public and health organizations. This alert system will create a network between public, local government, pharmacies as well as health organisations. If a patient has been detected with infectious disease, a text alert along with assistance needed to control the spread of disease, will be sent to every person in that particular area where disease is detected. Our system will also notify pharmacies about the infectious disease and will notify local government so that they will take preventive measures in order to stop spread of disease. Blockchain will be used to securely maintain all the records and maintain flow of data between all the entities.

## 4.Using gps and accelerometer data from mobile phone, predict tourist’s behavior (whether tourist will see a particular exhibit or visit a particular shop)
 
Abstract: Tourism is one of the industry that’s growing really fast. There are many aspects which are important to the industry- managing tourist attractions, improving marketing strategy and providing top-notch services to the tourists. To promote this industry, research scientists are already trying to decipher tourist behaviour. However, prediction of the tourist’s activities is still a problem. Investigating every tourist’s movement is a costly affair. Springer, Vienna, pp. 415–425, 2012, demonstrated the possibility of prediction is only using GPS installed in the tourist’s smartphone [1]. Through GPS, we can easily track the position of the tourist and save it for future references. Further prediction of tourist activities more precisely can be done using accelerometer. Accelerometer records the tourist’s basic movement, like walking or running, or is he chatting or on call. It also records posture of the person, whether he is sleeping or not, and in what position. The result shows that using GPS and accelerometer, it has become easier to predict the tourist behaviour.
