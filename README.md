Abstract:

Infectious diseases are leading cause of mortality and morbidity in all countries. In developing countries, the concern is detecting infectious disease outbreaks early and stopping their mortality, spread and potential impact on society. Epidemics alert system will act as mediator between public and health organizations. This alert system will create a network between public, local government, pharmacies as well as health organisations. If a patient has been detected with infectious disease, a text alert along with assistance needed to control the spread of disease, will be sent to every person in that particular area where disease is detected. Our system will also notify pharmacies about the infectious disease and will notify local government so that they will take preventive measures in order to stop spread of disease.
Blockchain will be used to securely maintain all the records and maintain flow of data between all the entities.
